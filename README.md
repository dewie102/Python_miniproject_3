# Python_miniproject_3

CAP Python Mini Project 1 - FLASK API!

1. First step after cloning the repo is to download all the requirements, do so by installing them using `pip` and the `requirements.txt` file as shown:
   `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

1. The todo.db should be included in the git repo, if it is not then you will need to run the setup_db.py script like so:
   `python3 setup_db.py`, which should create a `todo.db` file in the project root directory and you should be all set.

1. You will also need to create an `.env` file in the root directory with the following values:

```
SECRET_KEY="<Replace with some random string>"
DATABASE="todo.db"
```

After all of that, you should be able to run the app and play around, hopefully everything works as expected or you can figure out the problem. If not, please reach out.
