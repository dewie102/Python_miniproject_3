Todo App
sqlite3 as the database
	User -> name, ?
	Tasks -> name, create_date, due_date, complete, userID
	SubTask -> name, create_date, due_date, complete, TaskID

[GET]	
/ 				->shows welcome page

[POST]
/login			-> "logs in"

[GET]
/tasks			-> shows tasks for user

[GET, PUT]
/tasks/#		-> shows details for a particular task

[POST]
/tasks/create 	-> Creates a new task

[DELETE]
/tasks/delete/# -> Deletes a task


'''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Tasks
	(ID INT PRIMARY KEY			NOT NULL,
	name			TEXT		NOT NULL,
	create_date		DATETIME	NOT NULL,
	due_date		DATETIME,
	complete,		BOOLEAN,
	user_id,		INT, 		NOT NULL,
	FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users (id));```
	
'''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Sub_Tasks
	(ID INT PRIMARY KEY			NOT NULL,

	create_date		DATETIME	NOT NULL,
	due_date		DATETIME,

'''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Users

Would this be more of a many to many and therefore better to have a 3rd table that keeps track of which building a user is assigned to?

Having another table with

A | 1
A | 3
B | 1
B | 2

makes sense
